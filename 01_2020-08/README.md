## How-to: Auto reply to GitHub issues

#### Barbara Forbes

If your repository is growing, more issues might be coming up. Some automation can really help to keep the pressure down, manage expectations or simply let people know you are enjoying a holiday. In this talk, I will show you how you can make use of Azure Functions and the GitHub API to set up your own reply bot.

## Infrastructure as Code: Scaling deployments across customers

#### Wesley Haakman

Infrastructure as Code is often used for (re)deploying environments. Having the code in place to deploy your solution and/or infrastructure is one part of the puzzle. But what if you are software company or a service provider and you are looking to scale this deployment across customers? Each customer will have its variables. There are many solutions out there that will help you package and deploy your solution, but they all have their quirks and limitations. That is not to say you shouldn’t use them but going the “Do it yourself” route provides you with much more flexibility and a better understanding of what’s really happening. And with that understanding you can still choose to invest in a third-party solution for your provisioning needs.
During this session we will dive into a use case and leverage technologies such as (Azure) PowerShell, ARM Templates, Azure KeyVault and Azure Table Storage to achieve effortless deployments across customers.
